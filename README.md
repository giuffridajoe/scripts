##### *sox-script.sh* -

##### *myscript.ahk* - 
This script remaps keyboard keys to have other functions. Needs the AutoHotKey app to run
  
##### *split-file.sh* - 
This script will take a file as an argument and break it up into smaller ones. Records per file and the name of smaller files is passed into the split command.
