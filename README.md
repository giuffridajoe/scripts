# terminal-scripts
A collection of scripts that can be run from the terminal:

sox-script.sh - 
  this script uses the sox command line utility to concatenate multiple audio files into one file. it reads two columns from a file,         concatenates them together and gives it a name equal to whatever is in the third column. then it saves it somewhere
